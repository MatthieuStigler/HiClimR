# HiClimR
####A tool for `Hi`erarchical `Clim`ate `R`egionalization
`HiClimR` adds several features and a new clustering method (called, `regional` linkage) to hierarchical clustering in R (`hclust` function in `stats` library):

* regridding,
* coarsening spatial resolution,
* geographic masking,
* data filtering by thresholds,
* data preprocessing (detrending, standardization, and PCA),
* faster correlation function,
* hybrid hierarchical clustering, and
* cluster validation.
