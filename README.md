# HiClimR
A tool for hierarchical climate regionalization applicable to any correlation-based clustering. It adds several features and a new clustering method (called, regional linkage) to hierarchical clustering in R ('hclust' function in 'stats' library): regridding, coarsening spatial resolution, geographic masking, data filtering by thresholds, data preprocessing (detrending, standardization, and PCA), faster correlation function, hybrid hierarchical clustering, and cluster validation.
