Description: A tool for Hierarchical Climate Regionalization applicable to any correlation-based clustering.
             It adds several features and a new clustering method (called, 'regional' linkage) to hierarchical 
             clustering in R ('hclust' function in 'stats' library): data regridding, coarsening spatial resolution,
             geographic masking (by continents, regions, or countries), data filtering by mean and/or variance 
             thresholds, data preprocessing (detrending, standardization, and PCA), faster correlation function
             with preliminary big data support, different clustering methods, hybrid hierarchical clustering, 
             multivariate clustering (MVC), cluster validation, and visualization of region maps.
